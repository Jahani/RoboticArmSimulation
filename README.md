# Robotic Arm Motion Simulation
A tool for robotic arm simulation written in MATLAB
This is a 3-dof robotic arm with solid links that have different lengths and masses.
It considers initial conditions (angular position and velocity) and a constant torque on each joint.
You could change simulation time and step (time) between two frames.
Coulomb and Viscous Friction could be changed either.
The output is a simulation that will be shown in the GUI and an optional video file.
* Note that the gravity is considered in solving.
